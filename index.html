    <h1>Common Joins</h1>
    <p>
      A JOIN is a SQL clause that is used to combine rows from two or more
      tables based on a related column. The instructor discusses the different
      types of JOINs in more detail in the video; hereâ€™s a quick reference you
      can review as you follow along: INNER JOIN: a function that returns
      records with matching values in both tables LEFT JOIN: a function that
      returns all the records from the left table (first mentioned) and only the
      matching records from the right table (second mentioned) RIGHT JOIN: a
      function that returns all records from the right table (second mentioned)
      and only the matching records from the left table (first mentioned). OUTER
      JOIN: a function that combines the RIGHT JOIN and LEFT JOIN to return all
      matching records in both tables.
